# LoboCNC Original Source Code

This is the original source code for the LoboCNC milling machine. I am going to
attempt to port it to a modern compiler and possibly to the Rust programming
language at some point. But, since I was unable to find this posted anywhere
else I'm going to put it here for the general public to use in order to retain
access for those of us who have this machine and want to be able to keep using
it.
